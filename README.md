## 
The GD32E230G8U6, GD32E230C8T6, GD32F130K6T6, GD32F130K6T6, GD32F303CCT6, and others can be programmed over Arduino IDE using an awesome support package by CommunityGD32Cores https://github.com/CommunityGD32Cores/ArduinoCore-GD32
Those boards come with MCU datasheets, and PCB schematics, and are free to use. Although a proper credit would be nice.
